# Introduction üìñ
This project, titled "**Deep Learning Optimization for Tomato Plant Disease Image Classification**," is an academic endeavour assigned by Asia Pacific University Malaysia. The primary goal of this project is to implement and optimize a deep learning model to accurately classify diseases in tomato plants from images.

In this project, I will be working with a comprehensive dataset of tomato plant images, each annotated with specific disease labels. The focus will be on optimizing the deep learning model to achieve the best possible classification accuracy. The chosen model for this task is a hybrid **ResNet50-BiLSTM** model, which combines the strengths of ResNet50's deep convolutional neural network capabilities with BiLSTM's sequential data processing efficiency.

The ResNet50 component will act as a feature extractor, identifying and extracting relevant features from the tomato plant images. These features will then be processed by the BiLSTM component to capture temporal dependencies and patterns, further enhancing the model's ability to classify diseases accurately.

Throughout the implementation, various optimization techniques will be explored to improve the model's performance. These techniques may include hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, transfer learning, and fine-tuning of the model architecture.
